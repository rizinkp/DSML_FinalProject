# House Price Prediction - Data Structure and Machine Learning Final Project

### <u>Competition Description</u>
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

### <u>Goal</u>
To predict the sales price for each house based on various features. For each Id in the test set, we must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

### Project Overview
This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict house prices using a real-world dataset from Kaggle's House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition. The goal is to demonstrate a complete machine learning pipeline including EDA, preprocessing, modeling and evaluation.

#### Tools & Technologies Used
-> Programming Language: Python
-> Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, joblib
-> Environment: Jupyter Notebook
